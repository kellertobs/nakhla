"Major and trace element whole rock analyses were carried out; majors were analysed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) in the Department of Geology, University of Leicester and traces by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS; solution nebulised on a Thermo Finnigan Element 2 Sector-Field ICP-MS) at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford.

"Most samples were crushed in an agate pestle and mortar. 13 samples were, due to their hardness, crushed in a marble pestle and mortar. An internal check of this methodology highlights no contamination was gained from this method versus the primary method of using just an agate pestle and mortar. All samples were powdered in an agate ball mill. For major analyses approximately 5 g of sample was dried at 110˚C and the Loss on Ignition (LOI) was determined by heating at 800-900˚C in a furnace for 2 hours. After LOI determination, 0.6 g of sample was homogenised and fused with 3 g of a fine grained, eutectic mixture of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate in platinum crucibles. The fusion beads were analysed by XRF along with a selection of secondary standards (BHVO-2, AGV-2, BH-1, WS-1, BCS375, BCS376, MRG-1, JP-1, BCS372/1) that were chosen to bracket the elemental compositions of the unknowns.

"For trace analyses, 0.1 g of non-dried powder was digested in HF and HNO3 at 110˚C for 24 hours. Samples were dried and twice redissolved in HNO3 at 110˚C. Final disso- lution was in 3.75 ml of HNO3 and ~4 ml of Milli-Q at 110˚C for 12 hours. This final solution was diluted to a volume of 15 ml with Milli-Q. U.S. Geological Survey standards BHVO-2 and AGV-2 were additionally dissolved to verify the results for the unknown samples. For ICP-MS analyses, 20 μml of the sample solution was used for majors (Y,Zr, Nb, Mo, Pb, P, Sc, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Rb, Sr, Ba, Ce) and 200 μml of the sample solution for trace (Th, U, Cs, La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta) analysis. Each sample, major and trace runs, had 200 µml of an internal standard (I.S.; comprises Rh and Re), which was used to normalise and correct for any drift in the instrument during the run. This solution was diluted with 1780 μml (major and trace run) with HNO3. In addition to these solutions 18 spikes, per run, were made to correct for matrix a↵ects. Samples for the spikes were chosen so that they bracket the elemental compositions of the unknowns. Six spikes were made for three samples each run. These spikes were made up of 200 μml of I.S., 20 μml (major) or 200 μml (trace) sample solution and varying amounts of a standard, which when diluted with the HNO3 made up to a 2000 μml solution. The standard comprised of 5 elements that check the sensitivity of low, medium and high molecular mass elements and if there is any oxide or double charged molecules forming in the solution. A quality control (Q.C.; solution of standard and HNO3) sample was prepared and analysed for each run to check the cali- bration (i.e., acts as a secondary standard). Blanks were digested alongside the samples and analysed for each run too to detect any potential contamination of samples. Further internal checks were done by running the same sample, powder and solution twice. From all these checks we estimate the total trace element error as approximately 10% of the measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
